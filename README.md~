# Binary Classification of Tumor using gene expression data

## Synopsis
The dataset contains 62 samples collected from colon-cancer patients. Among them, 40 tumor biopsies are from tumors (labelled as "negative") and 22 normal (labelled as "positive") biopsies are from healthy parts of the colons of the same patients. Two thousand out of around 6500 genes were selected based on the confidence in the measured expression levels.
The task is to predict the presence of tumor based on the gene expression data.


## Data Preprocessing 
The dataset contains 2000 features for each input and the size of the dataset is 62,In this classfication task,The Multi level perceptron model is used to predict the class of tumor present or not. The positive samples are assigned to the output 1 and the negative samples are assigned to value 0.
The feature set is decreased to set of 6 features by PCA based on combined freature selection by selecting the 10 best features with means are more impact on the output and PCA the dataset on the 6 axis.
The 80% of the dataset is assigned to the training set and 20% is assigned to the test dataset.

## Prerequisities
The following softwares/Libraries are the prerequities for testing the model.
python 2.7
Matplotlib
sklearn
pandas
numpy

## Neural Network Model
The multi level perceptron model is used to classify the model
